        M/Y Bliss is a high performance Dutch-built superyacht offering a superb, ultra-luxury Mediterranean charter experience. This impressive 144’4” (44m) vessel has it all, with speed, style and a whole host of luxury amenities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Combining a sleek and sporty silhouette with outstanding performance, Bliss reaches impressive top speeds of 26 knots, with no compromise on comfort thanks to a modern stabilisation system and bow thrusters. This fresh and modern yacht was built by Heesen Yachts in 2007 and refitted in 2019, showcasing a stunning contemporary interior by Icelandic designer Ingibjorg St. Palmadottir. She offers spacious accommodation for 12 guests, making her an ideal choice for charter groups. Cabin space is versatile, consisting of a full beam master, three doubles and a bunk room, ideal for children. The upper lounge on the Skydeck can also be converted to a cabin for added flexibility. An elegant main salon forms the heart of the yacht, and is perfect for entertaining, enjoying sumptuous meals or simply relaxing. This is linked to the upper lounge by an impressive lit mirrored spiral staircase. Uninterrupted views are enjoyed from her extensive deck spaces, which include a large aft deck with exterior dining and seating, sunpads and a sunken seating area forward, and an upper deck with a Jacuzzi and sauna. A huge array of water toys and Bliss’s passionate and experienced crew guarantee a spectacular charter experience.
